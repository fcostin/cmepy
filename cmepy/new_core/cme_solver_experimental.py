    returns a solver for the Chemical Master Equation of the given model.
    
    arguments:
    
        model : the CME model to solve
        
        sink : If sink is True, the solver will include a 'sink' state used
            to accumulate any probability that may flow outside the domain.
            This can be used to measure the error in the solution due to
            truncation of the domain. If sink is False, the solver will not
            include a 'sink' state, and probability will be artificially
            prevented from flowing outside of the domain.
        
        p_0 : (optional) mapping from states in the domain to probabilities,
            for the initial probability distribution. If not specified,
            and the origin of the state space can be inferred, defaults
            to all probability concentrated at the origin, otherwise, a
            ValueError will be raised.
        
        time_dependencies : (optional) mapping of time dependent coefficient
            functions keyed by subsets of reaction indices, with respect to the
            ordering of reactions determined by the order of the propensity
            functions inside the model. The propensities of the reactions
            with indices included in the subset are multiplied by the time
            dependent coefficient functions. By default, no time dependent
            coefficient functions are specified, that is, the CME has
            time-independent propensities.
        
        domain_states : (optional) array of states in the domain.
            By default, attempt to infer the domain states assuming a
            rectangular domain defined by the 'np' entry of the model, and
            optionally also the 'norigin' entry. A ValueError is raised if both
            domain_states and model['np'] are unspecified.
