FspDomain :
-----------


it would be nice if it were possible to initialise all the auxillary data structures with empty sets / equivalent
ie if the FspDomain was initialised as empty, and the initial states were added via the extend method

this would hopefully unify the code in __init__ and extend of FspDomain and a bunch of other classes

issue:
    -- investigate how to have empty LexArraySets
        -- done it - it works fine as long as the dimension
           is explicitly passed to the constructor
