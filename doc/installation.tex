\section{Installation}

\subsection{Dependencies}
\cmepy{} was developed with \python{} 2.5.2, \scipy{} 0.7.0, \& \numpy{} 1.2.1 .
In addition, \matplotlib{} is used to display graphical output in some
examples, but is not otherwise a dependency.

\subsection{Testing \& Installation}

Once \cmepy{} has been obtained, the package can be tested and installed
by running the \mono{setup.py} script via \python{} as follows:

\mono{python setup.py test}

\mono{python setup.py install}

\subsubsection{Local package installation (Linux)}
If it is not possible to install \cmepy{} to the \python{}'s global
\mono{site-packages} directory, \cmepy{} may be installed locally to a user's
\mono{\$\{HOME\}} directory. First, ensure the path
\mono{\$\{HOME\}/lib/python} exists,
and that the \mono{\$\{PYTHONPATH\}}
environment variable includes
\mono{\$\{HOME\}/lib/python}. Then, \cmepy{} may be installed locally via

\mono{python setup.py install --home=\$\{HOME\}}

A (possibly better) alternative to this method of local installation is to
use the \mono{virtualenv} package to establish isolated (local)
\python{} environments. See \url{http://pypi.python.org/pypi/virtualenv}.
