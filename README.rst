Fork of CmePy v0.3, for dense FSP support
=========================================

This is a fairly experimental branch to make the FSP work without using implicit sparse dict conversion everywhere.

The old sparse functionality is unsupported, untested, and probably broken.

This has only been tested for the FSP simple expansion approach. The other one will be broken but it should be pretty easy to fix.

See examples/fsp_dense_io_example.py for a working demo with the simple expansion verison.
